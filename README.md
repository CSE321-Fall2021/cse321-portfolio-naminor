## About
This repository is a portfolio containing 3 Projects in the course CSE 321 - Realtime and Embedded Systems.

### Project 1
Setting up Mbed Studio, Creating code template, Setting up Git, Engineering Design Process, Establishing good coding and documentation practices.
### Project 2
A bare-metal and user-programmable count-down alarm system. There is functionality for the user to input the time duration of the timer as well as starting and stopping the timer. The time remaining on the timer and the completion of the timer is communicated to the user via an LCD screen and LEDs.
### Project 3
This project determines if something has passed through an area of interest using an ultrasonic sensor and notifies the user. The system can sound a buzzer if anything passes within a certain distance and the distance to the object can be displayed on the LCD screen. Different modes and the desired distance can be modified using the matrix keypad. This system can be used for safety applications such as keeping people away from dangerous areas, as a security alarm or placed on a vehicle to help a driver avoid collisions.
